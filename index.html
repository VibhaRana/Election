Over the past 22 years, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience. As the leader of 712 for the last 3 years, it has been my honor to make BIG CHANGES, delivering stronger representation to serve you better.</p>

With one foot out the door, they will retire out, before they figure it out. Then what? OUR TEAM has fought for victories in the trenches, and victories at the highest levels. We have proven we will go all the way, all day, to bring you strong representation. Help me keep this momentum moving forward, delivering on my 2021 campaign promises, and together we will continue carving new paths under my leadership.</p>

                    you for all your support! Please take a moment to meet our wonderful, long term, and loyal TEAM. Made
                    up of 712 Members who are ready to roll up their sleeves, put in the elbow grease, and help take 712 to

                    <p>I have worked in unionized manufacturing environments for over 30 years. Being raised pro-Union, I have held Officer positions in very strong Unions. Those skills and experiences are transferable and since coming to Local 712 10 years ago have been involved in some capacity. I have been a Shop Steward, Organizer, Delegate to the Ironworkers Convention, Business Agent, and currently, am your Vice President. I give my time and energy to daily operations and volunteer in all 712 events because I believe in Union fundamentals, family, and community. We already have a strong Business Manager in Mike MacIntosh. 712 needs a strong President who puts “principles before politics”. As YOUR President, I will accomplish what is in the best interest of the Members, not my ego. That guarantees the ship will be steered in the right direction. T.E.A.M = Together. Everyone. Achieves. More ⬈ Together as a TEAM, let’s level up!</p>

              <h3 class="modal-title">Vice President</h3>
              <p>I have been a 712 member for 24 years, 18 years working at Aggressive Tube Bending, and Chief Shop Steward for 12. During those 12 years, I got no support from 712 Business Agents and Business Managers. The Hall was like a ghost town. But with a passion for fair treatment in the workplace, I learnt how to fight for workers’ rights on my own. In 2021, I heard there was a new Business Manager elected and long overdue changes were happening at 712. I never thought I would ever work in a Union office, but with a desire to help people, in 2022, I applied. I was hired by the Local and sponsored by the International as an Organizer. Over that time, I have seen firsthand the commitment and passion our current Business Manager Mike MacIntosh puts in. The team he assembled drags knuckles with anyone at any time to bring better representation to you and your workplace. That brings comfort knowing you are protected, and that protection brings better stability for your families! During that same time some Officers constantly tried to drag him down at every turn. I have personally seen Mike MacIntosh rise above all the back door politics and do great work for 712 Members. It has been my honour to be a part of this TEAM and overcome any adversity or obstacle, and still bring big wins for 712 Members like better contracts, better representation, organizing, and everything in between. OUR TEAM will take on all challenges head on that come our way and we will continue to fight for the benefit of ALL, not just the few. Re-elect Mike MacIntosh for Business Manager, Lorie Swanky for President, and I fully support all the candidates that have joined our TEAM!! 712 ELECTION 2024</p>

With the right people in the right positions, we can do great things for the 712 Membership! I support Mike MacIntosh as our leader, he has put in a lot of work, done incredible things, and made big changes for 712. Most don’t know how much work he’s done, but I see it every month. Re-elect me to be your Recording Secretary for another 3 years, and we will right wrongs, and we will write the future.</p>

Chief Shop Steward for 25 years. In the past I was an

Executive Member for 8 years. I am now running again for Executive because I like what
I see with Mike MacIntosh as our Business Manager. My history, experience, knowledge,
and passion I bring to the table will remove the dirty politics and will be
a great asset to the daily operations of TEAM 712 - 2.0</p>

                   <p>I work at Ebco Industries and have been a 712 member for 35 years. Overall, my experiences with 712
                have been very negative. Over the last 3 years, I’ve seen positive changes under the leadership of Mike
                MacIntosh. That inspired me to step forward and take over the role of Chief Shop of a 100 -person
                company. That was a lot of work and I can confirm my efforts have brought positive results. I have also
                stepped up to be 712’s representative for women in the trades with the Ironworkers District Council.
                I am throwing my hat in the ring for an Executive position because I know I can make a positive contribution
                on behalf of the Members at Ebco Industries and Members all across the Province.</p>

                   <p> I work at Ebco Industries and have been a Member for almost 20 years. In 2022, I participated
                    in my first negotiations with Rusty, it was a very tough and exciting experience. We negotiated a good contract
                    and the workers were very happy. Since then, I have stepped forward as a Shop Steward, received good training
                    from the current 712 TEAM, and am enjoying making sure things run smoothly at my Company.
                    
                    I am running for Trustee because I know the passion that
                    I bring to the table will benefit all our 712 Members from all around the Local.</p>

Attending monthly General Meetings, I've seen the dedication of most of the current Local 712 team. Mike MacIntosh and Lorie Swanky negotiated our best contract yet. Now, I'm stepping up as a Trustee to strengthen our union for everyone.</p>
