                <p>With over 30 years of experience in unionized manufacturing environments and a background in pro-Union upbringing, I've held various Officer positions in strong unions. In my 10 years at Local 712, I've served as a Shop Steward, Organizer, Delegate to the Ironworkers Convention, Business Agent, and currently as Vice President. I am committed to Union fundamentals, family, and community, dedicating time and energy to daily operations and volunteering in all 712 events. As YOUR President, I prioritize Members' interests over ego, ensuring the ship is steered in the right direction. Let's level up together as a TEAM!<p>

Working alongside Business Manager Mike MacIntosh, I've seen his dedication firsthand. Together with our team, we've achieved significant wins for 712 Members. Let's re-elect Mike MacIntosh for Business Manager, Lorie Swanky for President, and support all candidates on our TEAM!</p>

With the right people in the right positions, we can do great things for the 712 Membership! I support Mike MacIntosh as our leader, he has put in a lot of work, done incredible things, and made big changes for 712. Most don’t know how much work he’s done, but I see it every month. Re-elect me to be your Recording Secretary for another 3 years, and we will right wrongs, and we will write the future.</p>

                I work at Ebco Industries and have been a 712 member for 35 years. Overall, my experiences with 712
                have been very negative. Over the last 3 years, I’ve seen positive changes under the leadership of Mike
                MacIntosh. That inspired me to step forward and take over the role of Chief Shop of a 100 -person
                company. That was a lot of work and I can confirm my efforts have brought positive results. I have also
                stepped up to be 712’s representative for women in the trades with the Ironworkers District Council.
                I am throwing my hat in the ring for an Executive position because I know I can make a positive contribution
                on behalf of the Members at Ebco Industries and Members all across the Province.

Under his leadership, alongside Ereen, Lorie, and Carlos, we've seen positive changes: recertification, and the best contract in Starline's history, including a $3 raise in the first year and $5 over three years. Mike always listens and delivers. I wholeheartedly support Mike MacIntosh for Business Manager, Lorie Swanky for President, Ereen Dizon for Vice President, and their team.
